    <p>FeatureSets are useful for grouping a set of proteinencoding gene features and performing some operation on that set of features. For instance, instead of specifying all the features in a list for each App, you can use this App to build a single FeatureSet and then use this as input for other Apps. There are quite a few Apps that accept a FeatureSet as input, including types of BLAST, MUSCLE, and expression analysis. FeatureSets are also shareable, so it allows you to call out or comment on specific features in your Narrative.</p>
